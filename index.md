On 23rd of June 2016, UK voted in a referendum. One of the campaign
promises during that referendum was additional funding of the
NHS. This promise has been broken, instead of an increase in NHS
spending, it has significantly decreased. GBP exchange rate dropped,
thus increasing significantly our current NHS costs; EU membership
fees; purchasing power and spending money.

During the campaign, it was stated that some people do not wish to pay
for EU membership and would rather spend that money towards the
NHS. I, on the other hand, am happy to pay for the EU membership. I am
also happy to pay for another person who doesn't, and I am also happy
to pay for NHS.

The true cost of the EU membership has been overstated at the time. As
per [Infacts](https://nationalhealthcoin.github.io/) the true cost of
EU membership is 26p. There is no direct taxation in the UK, thus I
cannot directly pay for the EU membership or directly contribute
towards the NHS. However, I can donate to an NHS trust the equivalent
amount of money.

Therefore I am happy to:

* donate 26p a day for my EU membership towards
* donate 26p a day for a leave voter EU membership
* donate 26p a day to simply fund NHS

Last year I have donated towards SASH Charity, Guy's & St. Thomas'
Charity, and Chelsea & Westminster Hospital. This year, I am donating
just towards the Guy's & St. Thomas' hospital as they have taken care
of me earlier this year when I walked in with Hepatitis A.

However, I am hoping for a networking effect and encourage more people
to donate towards Guy's & St. Thomas' hospital or any other NHS
Foundation Trusts.

How does this campaign affect government finances?  If you are UK tax
payer, the Foundation trust will be able to claim 25p on the pound
from the Government - in effect recouping the 20% base income tax
rate. Therefore, donating with GiftAid forces the government to divert
collected income tax towards the NHS. Furthermore, if you are a higher
rate tax payer you can write a letter to HMRC with justgiving receipt
to claim a further 20% income tax rebate, thus stretching every pound
even further. By encouraging GiftAid donations and encouraging people
to get income tax rebates I hope to have an impact on the government
finances and an increase in NHS funding.
